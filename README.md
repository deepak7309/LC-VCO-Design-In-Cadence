# LC-VCO-Design-In-Cadence
An LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is an electronic circuit that generates an oscillating output voltage whose frequency can be controlled by an applied voltage. It utilizes inductors (L) and capacitors (C) to create a resonant circuit, offering tunable frequency output for various applications like signal synthesis and frequency modulation.
